reduce memory consumption and improve debuggability of asn1 tests

Running the asn1 tests in parallel requires a lot of memory, and if
there is crash or multiple half-hour time trap timeouts, we won't know
which test case that caused the problem. Besides, it has always been
tricky to run tests in parallel because some test cases use the same ASN.1
specs and these test cases must not be run in parallel.

In this commit we will stop running asn1 test cases in parallel.

Not running test cases in parallel means that several more minutes
will be needed to run the entire asn1 test suite. Note that
`asn1_test_lib:compile_all/3`, which is used by some test cases, will
compile the given ASN.1 specs in parallel. We can shave off some time
by using `compile_all/1` in more places, for example by combining
test cases that test similar things.
